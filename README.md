# Chess Game with Enums

## Overview

This project is a work-in-progress implementation of a chess game using enums in C++. It aims to provide a structured and type-safe approach to handling chess pieces, moves, and board states.

## Features (Planned and Current)

- Logical move validation for all chess pieces.
- Enums-based design for:
  - Chess piece types (e.g., King, Queen, Pawn).
  - Piece colors (White, Black).
  - Board positions.
- Text-based display for gameplay visualization.

## Requirements

- C++11 or newer.
- A terminal or console to run the program.

## Current Status

- Enums are defined for chess pieces and their attributes.
- Basic board display implemented.
